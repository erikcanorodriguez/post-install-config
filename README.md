From Inside osTicket, we are able to access the admin panel and add new agents/roles. In the example above we are creating what is called a supreme admin which basically means this user has access to every and all permissions.

Next, we can create the departments that users will be classified in. Users can be added to all departments or just one in specific, it all depends on the role they have within the organization.

The SLA is basically the severity of each ticket in correspondence to the overall impact to the business. These SLA's can also be set through the admin panel from SEV-A to SEV-C.
